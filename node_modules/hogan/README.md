#hogan === hogan.js

**Why?** Because I didn't like doing...

```js
var hogan = require('hogan.js');
```

But I really like hogan :)

##Install

    npm install hogan

##Usage

```js
var hogan = require('hogan');
```

This is a simple alias to [hogan.js](http://twitter.github.io/hogan.js/) and you should check out its documentation!
