# Welcome

This is the continuation of the excellent Mitro password manager under
a new brand (https://passopolis.com/).

We split out the extensions into their own repository (this) for
easier development.

Unfortunately the extension builder scripts are all broken in their
current form. We have a hacked-together shell script that copies a few
files around and then packs the extension which we will release when
it's a bit less ugly.

# Branding

We're replacing the Mitro branding with our own Passopolis
branding. This makes it easier to understand that the service is still
active when searching on the Internet.
